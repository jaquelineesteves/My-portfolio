# Jaqueline Esteves Portfolio


## Description

This project was a great adding to my experience in HTML and CSS, it is my first time trying to build a page from zero. I have used more than 16 hours trying to figure out how to build this simple structure, it was important for me.
I practiced how to add links, add images, about hover, media query, about ID and class, how to use cards and variables.

## Usage
It is possible to click in the 'nav' bar to go to the about me, my work, contact and my linkedin. There's a link to my first application, and a link to my git hub in contacts.

--The google page isn't part of my Work, but I added beacuse I don't have lots of works, and my phone number is not correct.
